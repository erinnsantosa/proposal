## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will mainly display information about myself. This project is an advanced version of the homepage lab. It will feature HTML, CSS, and Javascript, Bootstrap, through CS50 IDE. When people are done looking through the homepage, they have the option to take a quiz about me. Players can input their name and attempt the quiz. After finishing, people will receive a score result in how much they know me.

First, I will make a design of how I want my homepage to look like. I will incorporate several HMTL, JavaScript, and CSS code to create the style and functions of my website. I will be looking through more Bootstrap presets to make the homepage more stylish and interactive. After developing the website, I will make a quiz. I will need to conduct research on how to do so.
